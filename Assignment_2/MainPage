In this assignment you can find 4 files, creating 4 programs
In the use_msgQ.cpp we create a program that spawns 2 childs, the second child sends
a fake message that is never read by the first child, then sends a greeting message to
the first child, the first displays the message and proceeds to add some content to the message
before sending the message back to the second child and exiting. The second child receives the message,
displays it and exits. The parent process deletes the queue it created for the 2 children.

The master.cpp creates a program that spawns two children who execute the binaries sender and receiver.
Those binaries are made from the sender.cpp and receiver.cpp code. The master creates a message queue
and spawns the children, each child replaces it's execution code by the code from the assigned binary.
The master waits for the 2 children to finish before deleting the queue and exiting. The sender program
sends a message to the queue and exits, the receiver waits for the message to appear in the queue and
displays it before exiting.
